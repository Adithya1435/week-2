# 📝 Assignment for Week 2

## DIY Smart Contract: **Deadman's switch**

- A well-known problem for cryptocurrency holders is that all funds are lost if the owner is incapacitated and has not shared his/her private key with anyone else.
- For this week’s submission, you are expected to write a smart contract that will send all of its balance to a pre-set address if the owner of that contract has not called a still_alive function on the contract in the last 10 blocks.

**Exercise:**

1. Design, write and deploy a deadman’s switch to goerli/sepolia

**Output**: 

Goerli/Sepolia address of your deployed contract *and* link to the GitHub repo for your contract’s code
